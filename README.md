# Image-classification-using-Transfer-Learning

This project focuses on building a deep learning-based image classifier that can distinguish images from six different categories. Given the relatively small dataset, the project employs transfer learning, leveraging powerful pre-trained models like ResNet50, ResNet100, EfficientNetB0, and VGG16. The approach involves freezing most layers of these networks while retraining only the final fully connected layer to adapt the model to the new dataset. To enhance generalization, various data augmentation techniques such as cropping, rotation, flipping, and contrast adjustment are applied. The training process incorporates ReLU activation, batch normalization, L2 regularization, dropout, and the ADAM optimizer, with a loss function tailored for multi-class classification. The model is trained for at least 50â€“100 epochs with early stopping based on a validation set. Overall, the project aims to create a robust and efficient classifier by utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques while optimizing performance through empirical regularization and fine-tuning. This was done as part of DSCI-552 Machine Learning for Data Science course.
